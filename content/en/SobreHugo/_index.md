# Hugo Instalation


## Windows

### First Step
To start we will create a folder that we will call Hugo within the root directory of our hard drive.
``` 
    C:\Hugo\bin\
    C:\Hugo\Sites\.
```

### Second Step
We could also do it from a Git Bash terminal with the following commands:
``` 
    cd c:
    mkdir Hugo
    cd Hugo
    mkdir bin Sites
```

### Third Step
Then we will go to the HUGO website and download the zip file to run it. We will unzip it into the created folder *C:\Hugo\bin\* .

Once all the steps have been completed, we will be able to use Hugo freely.



## Linux

### First Step
To start we will make sure that we have snap installed, since it is necessary to obtain the latest version of Hugo to avoid errors on the console.
``` 
    sudo apt-get install snap
```

### Third Step
Once we have made sure that we have snap, we proceed to put the command on the console:
``` 
    sudo snap install hugo --classic
```
