# Ricardo Fernandez

## CPIFP Student The Links in DAW

Hello, my name is Ricardo and I am 21 years old. I am currently studying a Higher Degree in Web Application Development at the CPIFP center in Los Enlaces.

I chose this degree mainly because I have always liked programming and it is a very good complement to the Web Application Development degree.

Among my main hobbies are videogames and the gym and within this I practice a category called **powerlifting**.
