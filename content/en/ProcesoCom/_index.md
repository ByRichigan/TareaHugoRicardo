# Communication Order Process

## 1 PHP Server Part Language
The request is sent to the server. The server receives it and starts creating everything based on what is received. PHP code snippets will be executed first. Then all queries are made to the Database. The result is a page with HTML and perhaps JavaScript.

## 2 Lenguage HTML
The browser receives the page from the previously mentioned process, interprets it and uses the HTML to build it.

## 3 JavaScript
As the web page is being built, all the JavaScript code is processed.

## 4 Conect JavaScript and PHP
Finally we will need a software that is able to join the JS with our PHP. In short, this, with the appropriate software, would allow us to make requests to the reviewer without the need for the page to be reloaded.
